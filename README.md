Put in 10 different parameters of your rice in the web app. Then a custom nural network that I built will classify it as gonen or Jasmine rice. Have fun!!! If you wanna try it out but dont know what to put in for values, just put in 2 digit numbers and it will be fine.




How to actually do this:
Istall requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
To run the app: python app.py

To train model: python main_model_training.py
